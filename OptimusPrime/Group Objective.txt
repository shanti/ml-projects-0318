Regression:
- Predict how many alerts/incidents we received after some event, like patches, outages, etc.
Once we have such info, we'll know the downtime and how many costumers were affected.
 
What info we need to collect:
1- How many patches did we have in the last 6 months?
2- How many alerts/incidents were created 24hs after the patche has been applied?
3- Is the operational system patched the same than the alert/incident?
4- How many applications were affected during the patch?
5- Is the alert/incident linked/related to the application affected by the patch? E.g.: DB Oracle (Linux) patched may affected a Web Application running on Windows (using the data from Oracle DB)
 
Info source: eView data, email reports and ServiceNow data.
 
Next state: classification
- Predict what kind of incidents we received during a patch or outage. 
Once we have such info, we'll know what teams we need to engage to bring the systems up again.
